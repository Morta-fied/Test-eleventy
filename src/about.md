<p>Hi! My name is Mark Joseph Morta. I am a multimedia designer with a focus on UI/UX & Graphic design. I was born in Anchorage, Alaska, raised in Northern California and now reside in the Bronx. I am inspired by 1980s & 1990â€™s Pop culture. I love the music, movies, fashion and aesthetics from those decades. Colors, patterns, and textures back then were unapologetically bold and bright. There is an element of nostalgia that I enjoy about it as well. I am currently pursuing a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College.
If you are curious about the type of work I do, check them out on the homepage!   </p>
